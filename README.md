# odin-recipes
The first HTML project as part of The Odin Project Foundations course.

## Assignment
Create and style a recipe website that linked to at least 3 different recipes.

## Approach
Referencing the course material closely, I created the landing page + 3 recipe links. To add more complexity, I downloaded pictures for each of the recipes and added those to each page. 

In terms of styling, as I learned more CSS in lessons that came _after_ this assignment, I came back to the project and updated colours and fonts. It was my first attempt at using the Google Fonts API to style headers on the landing and recipe pages. 

To replicate the modern websites I use on a daily basis, I justified everything center. 

Out of curiosity, I used CSS to change button behaviour when the cursor hovers on them.

The overall outcome is something basic, but clean-looking.
