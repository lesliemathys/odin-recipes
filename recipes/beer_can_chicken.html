        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A whole chicken is seasoned and slowly cooked on the grill. 
            This is a bit unorthodox, but the end result is moist, flavorful, and amazing. 
            All you'll need is some chicken, butter, beer, and seasonings.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>1 cup butter</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons garlic salt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can beer</li>
                <li>1 (4 pound) whole chicken</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for low heat.</li>
                <li>In a small skillet, melt 1/2 cup butter. Mix in 1 tablespoon garlic salt, 1 tablespoon paprika, salt, and pepper.</li>
                <li>Discard 1/2 the beer, leaving the remainder in the can. Add remaining butter, garlic salt, paprika, and desired amount of salt and pepper to beer can. Place can on a disposable baking sheet. Set chicken on can, inserting can into the cavity of the chicken. Baste chicken with the melted, seasoned butter.</li>
                <li>Place baking sheet with beer and chicken on the prepared grill. Cook over low heat for about 3 hours, or until internal temperature of chicken reaches 180 degrees F (80 degrees C).</li>
